# Stakra - Enhanced Reputation Protocol (ERP)

A Clarity smart contract for managing decentralized participant reputation in a trust-minimized ecosystem. This protocol blends staking, evaluation, and governance into a unified reputation system, ensuring fairness, accountability, and adaptability over time.

---

##  Overview

The **Enhanced Reputation Protocol** is a blockchain-based system that enables:

- Transparent and weighted reputation scoring
- Participant staking and collateral-based accountability
- Authorized evaluator roles with accuracy scoring
- Decay of reputation over time to incentivize continued engagement
- Governance for parameter tuning and protocol evolution

It is designed for **DAOs, decentralized identity systems, contributor networks**, and any system requiring trust-layered participant metrics.

---

##  Features

### Reputation Management
- Reputation scores range from 0 to 100.
- Scores are affected by weighted evaluations based on evaluator accuracy.
- Inactivity triggers **temporal decay** of reputation.

###  Staking and Economic Safeguards
- Participants must lock a minimum amount of STX as **collateral**.
- Collateral is tracked and can be adjusted based on governance rules.

###  Evaluator System
- Evaluators are permissioned and have their own accuracy metrics.
- Evaluations influence participant reputation and are tracked per epoch.

###  Governance Mechanism
- Proposals can be made and voted on.
- Parameter tuning (e.g. epoch length, thresholds) can be governed.
- Voting periods and proposal thresholds are enforced.

###  Evaluation Ledger
- Stores historical evaluation data by epoch.
- Includes metadata and timestamp for auditability.

---

## Deployment & Usage

### Register as Participant

```clarity
(register-participant u1000)
```

- Locks collateral and registers user with maximum reputation.

### Submit Evaluation

```clarity
(submit-participant-evaluation '<participant-principal>' u85 (some "Contributed effectively in Q2"))
```

- Evaluators can submit evaluations that adjust a participant's score based on weighted logic.

### Update Protocol Parameters

```clarity
(update-protocol-parameters {
  min-reputation: u10,
  max-reputation: u100,
  collateral-requirement: u2000,
  epoch-length: u288
})
```

- Only callable by the protocol administrator.
- Must pass validation checks.

### Read Participant Profile

```clarity
(get-participant-profile '<participant-principal>')
```

- Returns decayed reputation, collateral, status, and evaluation count.

##  Data Structures

### `participant-registry`
Stores each participant's:
- Reputation score
- Last activity epoch
- Collateral balance
- Evaluation count
- Status ("ACTIVE", "SUSPENDED", "PROBATION")

### `evaluation-ledger`
Tracks evaluations by:
- Epoch
- Participant
- Score details and evaluator metadata

### `evaluator-credentials`
Tracks:
- Evaluator authorization
- Evaluation accuracy
- Count of evaluations made

### `governance-proposals`
Tracks:
- Proposer, votes, description
- Proposal status: `"ACTIVE"`, `"PASSED"`, `"FAILED"`, `"EXECUTED"`

## üß™ Tests & Audits

Make sure to write unit tests for:

- Edge cases in scoring bounds
- Access control (admin-only functions)
- Evaluator permission logic
- Proposal lifecycle: creation ‚Üí voting ‚Üí execution
